                    Kenya is an underdeveloped country in Africa
                    and many people do not think of visiting it however, if you are someone who is 
                    looking for a charity trip, education on different cultures and more look no further. 
                    MEtoWe is a social enterprise that holds charity trips to educate people on their five main pillars
                    and teach you how to apply them in helping underdevelopied countries. So they are action based instead
                    and allow you to experience the reality of the struggling countries in order to see from their perspective
                    and take action.

                   The Five pillars
                </h1>
                <p class="text-small">
                    Me to We focus on five different pillars that they believe are the most 
                    important to make a change. Stating them will also highlight how connected they are.
                    The five pillars include health, food, water, opportunity and education. 
                    Health is a vital aspect because if the child or parent is not healthy they will not be 
                    able to attend school, food security is another pillar as hungry or malnurished children 
                    will obviously be inattentive and sick and will not be able to attend school. The opportunity pillar
                    focuses on the fact that children will only be able to attend school if their parents have financal support
                    and time to invest in their education. The next pillar is water and children (especially girls) can only attend
                    school if they have access to clean water because having reliable water for their families will free theme
                   from their daily task of collecting water and will prevent waterborn illnesses. The final pillar is
                   education, empowering people, especially children with the knowledge, skills and confidence to develop
                   their capabilaties is the best way to set them up for success and break the cycle of poverty. 
                   Where does Me to We come in all this? Well, they partner with communities to implement sustainable clean
                   water as well as hand pumps, they implement health initatives such as hospitals, moobile clinics and 
                   vaccination programs,they place programs that promote food security and improved agriculture and irrigation
                   projects to establashing local farms, they work with families to implement productive resoureses such as 
                   goats and provide relevant financial literacy training to generate incomes and finally they ensure children
                   have access to quality education by bulding schools.

                Kenya is one of the world's magnificent wildlife destinations. It is home
                to some of the highest and most diverse populations of wildlife on the planet. 
                It offeres a unique chance to see the wildlife in flesh! An african safari is the only way 
                you can track down wild animals and watch their beauty and power. 
                In my visit there I was able to see a lion close up, giraffes and gizzells running around 
                and got to picnic over the view of the hippos. This attraction is a very recommended once in a lifetime
                experience.
